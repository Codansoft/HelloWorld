I'm a senior software architect. I'm passionate about new technologies, programming and agile methodologies. I spent many years working for international corporations on a number of projects. During that time I gained a solid experience, not only in technical field but also in application life-cycle management and customer relationship.
At some point of my career I started receiving projects from local companies. Then I noticed the difference between mid-size companies and corporations - the dynamic. Decisions can made instantly instead of weekly approval processes. They adapt much more quicker to market changes. Waterfall management is no longer effective in today's world.   
Here the decision has been made to ground that project. To form a group of IT professionals with passion. Our mission is not only to provide services that market needs but also to be innovative and be part of the IT revolution. Shape the future. Making the world a better place.

I really enjoy to build IT solutions 

coach, or teach, people who wants to learn programming, from beginners to skilled programmers. Involved in local developer communities, Java User Group, PHP User Group, or Javascript User Group, i like to share with others about experiences, news or business. Coding is FUN !
